## **Project Objective**

This project presents **VoteGuard**, a comprehensive enterprise-grade cloud-based voting system designed to demonstrate advanced cloud computing concepts, database management, and secure web application development. The primary objective is to develop a scalable, secure, and transparent electronic voting platform that ensures data integrity, voter privacy, and real-time election management.

The system implements **role-based access control** (Voters, Admins, Super Admins), **end-to-end encryption** for vote security, and **comprehensive audit logging** for transparency and compliance. Built on modern cloud architecture using **Supabase** (PostgreSQL as a Service), the platform showcases cloud-native features including real-time subscriptions, row-level security, auto-scaling, and serverless functions. The application is deployed on **Vercel**, leveraging edge functions, automatic deployments, and global CDN distribution.

Key features include real-time election analytics, multi-factor authentication, security monitoring with threat detection, and advanced reporting capabilities. The system adheres to **ACID compliance** principles, implements **3NF normalization**, and utilizes stored procedures, triggers, and optimized indexing strategies for performance.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, JWT authentication, bcrypt encryption
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) with pgcrypto extension, real-time capabilities
- **Cloud Platform:** Vercel (hosting, edge functions, CI/CD), Supabase (database, authentication, storage)
- **Additional Tools:** Lucide React (icons), Nodemailer (email), Twilio (SMS), UUID generation
- **Security:** Multi-layered encryption, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, CSRF tokens, Row-Level Security (RLS)

The project successfully demonstrates cloud deployment, scalability, security best practices, and professional software engineering principles suitable for real-world enterprise applications.
