* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs

### JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide

All JavaScript/TypeScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

* 2 spaces for indentation
