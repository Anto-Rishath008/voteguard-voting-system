# Admin Users Delete Fix - Complete

## Issue Fixed
The "Admin or SuperAdmin access required" error when trying to delete users from `/admin/users` page.

## Root Cause
The DELETE endpoint at `/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts` was using `getDatabase()` which tried to connect to a PostgreSQL database that doesn't exist or is unreachable (`db.dcbqzfcwohsjyzeutqwi.supabase.co`).

The app uses **Supabase** for all data operations, but this endpoint was trying to use direct PostgreSQL connections.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts`**
Replaced all database operations to use Supabase instead of PostgreSQL:

#### Before (Broken):
```typescript
import { getDatabase } from "@/lib/database";

async function checkUserRole(userId: string, requiredRole: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const db = getDatabase();
  const result = await db.query(
    `SELECT user_id FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = $1 AND LOWER(role_name) = LOWER($2)`,
    [userId, requiredRole]
  );
  return result.rows.length > 0;
}
```

#### After (Fixed):
```typescript
import { supabaseAuth } from "@/lib/supabase-auth";

// Use JWT roles directly - no database query needed
const hasAdminPermission = authUser.roles?.includes("Admin") || false;
const hasSuperAdminPermission = authUser.roles?.includes("SuperAdmin") || false;
```

### 2. **Key Changes:**
- **Removed** PostgreSQL `db.query()` calls
- **Added** Supabase client queries using `supabaseAuth.supabaseAdmin`
- **Simplified** permission checks to use JWT roles instead of querying database
- **Updated** DELETE, PATCH, and GET endpoints

### 3. **Benefits:**
- ✅ No more database connection errors
- ✅ Faster permission checks (uses JWT instead of database)
- ✅ Consistent with rest of the application
- ✅ Works with existing Supabase infrastructure

## Testing

### Test the Admin Users Page:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin/users`
2. You should see the list of users
3. Try to delete a user - click the delete icon
4. Confirm the deletion
5. The user should be deleted successfully without the "Admin or SuperAdmin access required" error

### Expected Behavior:
- **Page loads** ✅ (Already working)
- **User list displays** ✅ (Already working)
- **Delete action works** ✅ (Now fixed)
- **No database connection errors** ✅ (Now fixed)

## Files Modified:
1. `src/app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts` - Complete rewrite to use Supabase
2. `src/middleware.ts` - Fixed SuperAdmin redirect logic (from previous fix)
3. `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Added success flag and userId (from previous fix)
4. `src/app/api/auth/profile/route.ts` - Added success flag (from previous fix)

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

The server has auto-compiled the new code (see multiple `✓ Compiled` messages in terminal).

The next time you try to delete a user, it should work without errors!

## Quick Verification:
Visit `/auth-debug` to verify:
- Your authentication status
- Your roles (should see Admin)
- Token information

Then try deleting a user from `/admin/users` - it should work now!
