## üìù Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Go to the registration page
2. Fill in basic information (Step 1)
3. Click **"Create Account"** to register immediately
4. OR click **"Preview Next Steps"** to see upcoming features
5. If previewing, use **"Back to Registration"** to return to Step 1

### For Developers:
The original step components (`renderStep2`, `renderStep3`, etc.) are still in the code but not currently used. They can be easily re-enabled when the features are ready by:

1. Changing the step rendering logic
2. Updating the validation to include all steps
3. Switching back to `signUpEnhanced()` in `handleSubmit()`

## üîÑ How to Re-enable Full Registration (Future)

{currentStep === 3 && renderStep3()}  // Instead of renderUnderConstruction(3)
{currentStep === 4 && renderStep4()}  // Instead of renderUnderConstruction(4)
{currentStep === 5 && renderStep5()}  // Instead of renderUnderConstruction(5)
```

2. Update `handleSubmit()` to use `signUpEnhanced()`

3. Update validation to require all steps
